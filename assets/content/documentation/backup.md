# Backup your settings

### Creating a backup

If you have lots of custom settings, you can backup them using the _tools > Backup all settings_ option.

This will provide a zipped .fdz file, containing the settings.

### Restore the settings

To restore the settings, simply open the .fdz file using HaxeDevelop.
